# MAKECEEFAX.php
MAKECEEFAX.php is a set of scripts which generate a BBC Ceefax service from various websites, including the BBC and the Met Office. The system is designed to be modular so that you can decide what pages you want or don't want. Please see the Wiki for information on reporting errors, setting up the system for the first time and a configuration reference.

## Coming Soon:
I plan to release a TV listings module in the next few weeks. It will produce listings for BBC1&2, CH4 & CH5. Unfortunately I can't get ITV listings easily because of royalty fees.
The documentation badly needs updating and I'd like to add more cconfiguration options to the existing modules, so that should come soon as well.
