# MAKECEEFAX.php
MAKECEEFAX.php is a set of scripts which generate a BBC Ceefax service from various websites, including the BBC and the Met Office. The system is designed to be modular so that you can decide what pages you want or don't want. For set up instructions for a Raspberry Pi, see the wiki. More details on the config files will be avilable in the wiki shortly.
